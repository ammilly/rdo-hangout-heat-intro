# RDO Hangout: Introduction to Heat

This is a set of slides (in the `slides` directory) and templates (in
the `templates` directory) used in the "Introduction to Heat" RDO
Hangout:

- <https://plus.google.com/events/c9u4sjn7ksb8jrmma7vd25aok94>

You can view the slides online here:

In order to use the templates included in this repository you will
need to edit the file `templates/local.yaml` and configure it with
values appropriate to your environment.

The script `templates/test-templates.sh` will verify that all the
templates work as expected.  Note that it can take some time to
complete deployment of these stacks; on my system, deploying from the
`wp-simple.yaml` template takes about 15 minutes.
